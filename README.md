...because I really don't want to use Sublime on your interviewing machine.

These work on recent versions of Max OS X and utilize [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)
for configuration automation.

## How to install

Consult [`manual`](manual) for pre- and post-flight manual activities, then
run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamesreggio/dotfiles/master/bootstrap.sh | sh
```
